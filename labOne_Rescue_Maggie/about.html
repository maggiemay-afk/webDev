    <div id="who we are"> 
      <p> Wild Rescues is a non-profit wild animal and livestock sanctuary located in south-central Wisconsin,
        just outside the city of Madison. We were founded in August of 1998 
        by two sisters who grew up in Wisconsin and share a love for wildlife and the outdoors. Since our founding,  
        we have been helping all breeds of wildlife and livestock by providing any care, shelter, or other 
        rehabilitation services they may need. Since our founding, we have treated over 20,000 animals in the 
        greater Wisconsin area. In addition, we've had over 200,000 visitors, worked with over 
        4,000 volunteers, and held over 1,000 educational and training programs.<br><br>
        At Wild Rescues our mission is to treat any sick, injured, or abandoned animal, before returning them to 
        the wild or placing them in a loving forever home. We believe that all forms of life are sacred and deserve 
        love, care, and affection. That's why we're a strict no-kill shelter and a proud advocate for the well-being
        of wildlife. Wild Rescues is a member of the <a href="https://www.nwrawildlife.org/" 
        target="blank" class="link">National Wildlife Rehabilitation Association</a>
