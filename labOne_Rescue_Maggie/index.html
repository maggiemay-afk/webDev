    <p> At Midwest Wildlife Rescue, we take in any sick, injured, or abandoned wildlife or large livestock breed.
        Our goal is to rehabilitate these animals by providing world-class care, and then release them back into the wild.
        For our livestock rescues, we look for loving forever homes where these animals can relax in paradise.
        If any animal is unable to be released back into the wild, we provide shelter and a forever home - 
        our rescue is a haven for animals and is a strict no-kill shelter.
